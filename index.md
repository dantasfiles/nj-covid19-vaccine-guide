# NJ COVID-19 Vaccination Unofficial Location Guide

This page simplifies the information from the official NJ location list into a format that's easier to act on. Please [contact me](https://github.com/dantasfiles) with any corrections or suggestions. This page was last updated Jan. 23.

> *This page is not affiliated with the state of NJ nor any of the healthcare providers listed here. The information here may be inaccurate or out-of-date. New Jersey has an **[official COVID-19 vaccine location list](https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/covid-19-vaccine-locations-for-eligible-recipients)**. Please visit that page for the most up-to-date and accurate information.*

Tip: Follow the Facebook page of the location you are trying to use. Click  `...` -> `Follow Settings` -> `Notifications` -> `Posts` -> `Standard` to have your phone buzz when the location makes a new post, hopefully about vaccine availability.
